    "main_content": "If you’re considering earning a [Master of Science in Computer Science](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-computer-science-boston-5238/) (MSCS), then you undoubtedly have a lot of questions running through your mind:\n[What can I do with an MS in CS?](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/computer-science-career-options/)[What kind of jobs do MS in CS graduates typically hold?](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/popular-master-in-computer-science-jobs/)[Will earning my MS in CS help me get a job after I graduate?](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/computer-science-masters-degree/)[Is earning a master’s degree in computer science even worth it?](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/is-masters-in-computer-science-worth-the-investment/)\nAll of these questions are important to answer before deciding to pursue a graduate degree, but the last one is especially critical. Before you invest the time, effort, and money into earning any degree, you should know whether or not that investment is going to lead to the kind of returns you want.\nDo need a master’s degree to reach my career goals?\nWhether or not earning a degree is worth it depends largely on how you personally define “worth.” What needs to happen, in your mind, to make earning a specific degree worthwhile? Does it need to lead to a certain job or career path? Does it need to offer [job growth and stability](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/careers-where-graduate-degree-pays-off/)? Does it need to offer a certain salary?\nMany people use salary to decide whether or not earning a particular degree is worthwhile, and for good reason: It’s an easy way to gauge return on investment. If being paid a high salary is important to you, then earning an MSCS is one way of getting there.\nThe [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm) predicts that overall employment in computer and information technology jobs will increase by about 377,500 openings per year from 2022 to 2032. This growth is much faster than average, and employers are likely to struggle in finding qualified professionals to fill these roles. Because of this high demand and low availability of skilled professionals, pay in the field is expected to remain high, especially for roles that require more education than a bachelor’s degree.\nTo put this into perspective, here’s a look at 11 positions popular among MSCS graduates—from security engineer to senior software developer—and the average salaries those roles command.\nDownload our free guide to breaking into computer science.\nWhether you have a technical or nontechnical background, here’s what you need to know.\nHighest-paying jobs for MSCS graduates\n1.
