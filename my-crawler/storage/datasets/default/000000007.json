    "main_content": "What can you do with a computer science degree? There are many fascinating career paths and technical skills to explore in this industry.\nThe tech industry is growing rapidly, making computer science an important field of study for individuals hoping to pursue a career in this area. According to the [Tech Council of Australia](https://techcouncil.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/QldTechJobsUpdateJul23_v4_0727.pdf), in Queensland alone, there are currently 140,000 tech workers, which is a 15% share of Australia’s tech workforce. This is expected to rise to 180,000 workers by 2030, making job opportunities in computer science look promising.\nComputer science encompasses a variety of occupations, however, which may leave you wondering ‘which computer science career is right for me?’\nLet’s explore some of the popular career choices for computer science graduates.\nMachine learning engineer\nA machine learning engineer works closely with artificial intelligence (AI), designing and building the software that automates it.\nWhat do machine learning engineers do?\nMachine learning engineer duties include:\n- analysing large datasets\n- assessing the quality of data\n- setting up machine learning algorithms\n- running tests\n- collaborating with other data scientists\n- maintaining and finding ways to improve machine learning models already in production.\nMachine learning engineer skills\nApart from technical skills learnt through study, machine learning engineers also need to be able to:\n- problem solve\n- communicate clearly\n- work as a team\n- interpret complex information\n- understand advanced mathematical concepts.\nMachine learning engineer salary\nMachine learning engineer salaries can range from $90,000 to $140,000, with the national average sitting at $118,800 according to 107 salaries reported to [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Salaries/machine-learning-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,25.htm).\nHow to start a career as a machine learning engineer\nMachine learning engineers need to develop technical skills that are very specific to their work. To do this, you’ll need to complete undergraduate studies and sometimes also postgraduate studies at university. UQ’s [Bachelor of Computer Science](/study-options/programs/bachelor-computer-science-2451), majoring in [Machine Learning](/study-options/programs/bachelor-computer-science-2451/machine-learning-machdc2451), will help you prepare for a career as a machine learning engineer.\n‘Machine learning engineer’ appears on [LinkedIn’s 2023 Jobs on the Rise list](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-jobs-rise-2023-25-roles-australia-growing-/) – indicating that it’s one of the 25 fastest growing job titles in Australia over the past 5 years. According to LinkedIn data, 16% of machine learning engineers hold only a bachelor’s degree, while 84% hold a master’s degree or higher.\nSecurity architect\nA security architect helps prevent cybercrime by designing, creating and maintaining security systems in an organisation’s IT network.\nWhat does a security architect do?\nSecurity architect responsibilities include:\n- identifying vulnerabilities in an organisation’s systems\n- running tests to find opportunities for hackers to target and fixing them\n- staying on top of the latest security systems and standards\n- being aware of the latest threats and putting measures in place to protect against them\n- defining and implementing security procedures and policies for all employees.\nSecurity architect skills\nSecurity architects need to learn technical skills in relation to a wide range of systems and programs, which are often honed both during university studies and through experience. They also benefit from the following soft skills:\n- critical thinking\n- problem solving\n- working calmly under pressure\n- attention to detail\n- forward thinking\n- clear communication.\nSecurity architect salary\nAs a security architect is not an entry level position, the salary for this role in Australia is quite high. Salaries can range from $109,000 to $199,000, with the average sitting at $153,000 based on 51 salaries reported to [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/AU/Job=Security_Architect%2C_IT/Salary).\nHow to start a career as a security architect\nYou can begin your training to pursue a career in cyber security by studying UQ’s [Bachelor of Computer Science](/study-options/programs/bachelor-computer-science-2451), majoring in [Cyber Security](/study-options/programs/bachelor-computer-science-2451/cyber-security-cyberc2451). You will likely need to work your way up to the position of security architect and undergo further studies to build upon your technical, interpersonal and managerial skills.\nIs it hard to get a computer science job?\nMany jobs in computer science are technical specialisations that require university-level study [combined with at least 3 years of experience](https://techcouncil.com.au/wp-content/uploads/240229-SouthStart-Report_VF.pdf). Individuals need to start in entry level positions and work their way up into these roles. There is certainly demand for tech jobs in Australia, but many require university qualifications to get a foot in the door. Having an undergraduate degree in computer science will give you a competitive edge to help you start your career progression. Undertaking postgraduate study will help you hone your skills to specialise in a technical profession.\nIt may be hard to get a computer science job if you aren’t proactive and enthusiastic about continual learning. In an ever-changing tech landscape, it’s critical to stay on top of new technology and systems. A commitment to lifelong learning will certainly help you thrive in this area.\n![UQ students study with laptops in a light-filled classroom with greenery in background](/sites/default/files/styles/embedded/public/2024-03/Careers_in_computer_science_inline_0.jpg?h=034a72b7&itok=xK2TRp-Z)\nSoftware programmer\nSoftware programmers take an idea or project and transform it into a program by creating the code that makes it work. They design, develop, test and maintain program code based on user requirements and technical specifications.\nWhat does a software programmer do?\nSoftware programmers perform the following duties regularly:\n- write and test code\n- make sure programs perform to specification\n- debug and troubleshoot software to keep everything running smoothly and enhance user satisfaction\n- rewrite code in different languages to make programs compatible with different systems\n- work closely with developers, engineers and cyber security specialists to ensure programs are optimised, safe and efficient.\nSoftware programmer skills\nThe soft skills needed to be a software programmer include:\n- multitasking\n- attention to detail\n- perseverance\n- problem solving\n- adaptability\n- analytical thinking.\nHow to start a career as a software programmer\nPrepare for a career in programming by studying UQ’s [Bachelor of Computer Science](/study-options/programs/bachelor-computer-science-2451), majoring in [Programming Languages](/study-options/programs/bachelor-computer-science-2451/programming-languages-prolac2451).
